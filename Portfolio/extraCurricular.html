    <h2>Extra Curricular Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As a member of the Institute of Physics I have attended many lectures over the past year during my time at university.
            Becoming involved with physics outside of my degree, it’s not just a career, it’s a passion.</li> <br/>
        <li>Vice President & Social Secretary of the Astronomy and Physics Society at NTU for 2 years. Running the society and
            its events, by scheduling, budgeting and negotiating with the student union. It involves pushing for memberships,
            and organising trips abroad.</li><br/>
        <li>During my time at Eaton Bank Academy, I was elected deputy Head Boy and then Head Boy in my final year. Representing
            the school in the wider community, I mentored students and met with parents and teachers. My role involved public
            speaking at school open evenings in front of prospective students and their parents. </li><br/>
        <li>Black belt in Ju-Jitsu, showing determination and hard work to reach this level by the age of 16.  I also taught
            juniors learning Ju-Jitsu, gave demonstrations and showed what skills were needed to gain their next grading.</li><br/>
        <li>Being a member of the local Youth Council, getting the young voices heard and being involved with all the town’s
            important activities. As part of this, I helped deliver a letter to our local MP at the Houses of Parliament,
            making sure they knew what the young people of the area were hoping the council could make progress on. </li><br/>
        <li>Travel is one of my favourite pastimes. I am very passionate about visiting new countries and experiencing new cultures.
            I have visited opposite ends of the spectrum regarding wealth and cultures and every time I learn and gain personally
            from these experiences. I’ve travelled on my own many times, showing organisation and commitment of my own accord.</li><br/>
    </ul>
